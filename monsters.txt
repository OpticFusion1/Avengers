~At first the corpse wings was no more than a chill in the air, a shimmer of mist, diffuse. Through ~it the furniture and the wallpaper that peeled with the rising damp became slightly out of focus, ~like a poorly taken photograph

~It rose, a mass of tangled limbs, each one armour plated with a paralyzing goo seeping from black pores. The monster clicked it's mandibles and followed me with it's enormous compound eye.

~The tunnel had been abandoned decades before Mike and Jake had been born. Its brickwork ~had begun to crumble and its mouth gaped black and dank. They exchanged mischievous ~grins and dared each other to go in.

@nVampire(Boss)
~Without warning the vampire appeared. With skin as pale as freshly poured milk and fangs ~protruding over the thin blue lips, he stood staring. Running or screaming seemed pointless, ~then inexplicably the vampire seemed to melt away into the shadows as soundlessly as it had ~arrived.

~The monster was a predator. His frontal eyes were better than any hawk and his teeth sharper ~than steak knives. He moved in the shadows until his victim was in reach and then the ~tentacles would shoot out and pull them into his mouth.

~The monster didn't need bulk, her muscles were many times stronger than her human prey. ~She was little more than a wisp of a creature with diminutive limbs and still took down the meal ~of her choice each dawn.
